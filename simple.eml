OK. I have to figure out where the heck I'm going on the 21st, but that will be fine.

I'll get back to you on furniture prices, but they'll be reasonable.

I think we should just tell Jim what our plan is and see how he wants to sort out the month of rent I already paid and the deposit. If it turns out he wants you to pay me and me to pay rent that's fine too. I'll probably continue to deal with the bills, since that's easier and just charge whoever is actually living in the house.

I was hoping you would pay full rent for whatever full months you're in the house. I can cover May. I'm thinking of this as a lease transition, not a sublet. Does that work for you? 

Mickey
